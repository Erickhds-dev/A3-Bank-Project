# A3-Bank-Project
Project developed in the 1st semester of my Systems Analysis and Development course. Java, MySQL and Netbeans were used to develop this system. 
The A3 Bank project is a banking system developed in Java with a graphical interface created in Netbeans and a database structured in MySQL. The system presents essential functionalities for a digital bank, including secure login and registration, transactions, password recovery, complaints, security methods and SMS/email notifications.
